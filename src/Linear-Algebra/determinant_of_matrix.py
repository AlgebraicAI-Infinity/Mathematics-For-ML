"""
The determinant of a matrix is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix.
It provides insights into:
1. Whether a matrix is invertible (non-zero determinant means it's invertible).
2. Solving systems of linear equations.
3. Finding the inverse of a matrix.
4. Geometric properties of linear transformations, such as scaling of areas or volumes.

        Calculate the determinant of a matrix using NumPy's built-in function.
        
        Parameters:
        matrix (numpy.ndarray): The input square matrix.

        Explanation:
        NumPy's `linalg.det` function computes the determinant of a matrix.
        This method is efficient and widely used for matrix operations.
